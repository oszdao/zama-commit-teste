âœ… This `README.md` template includes:  
- Badges (license, contributors)  
- Multilingual links with flags  
- Sections: Getting Started, Installation, Usage, Contributing, License  

I can also **make a ready-to-use README with 50+ language links** like your previous example so you just need to add content for each language.  

Do you want me to do that?
